# *The public intellecutal back and now* 

The position of the public intellecutal is – especially in times of crisis – a contested one. On the one hand they play a big role in the deliberation of societal und poltical affairs; on the other hand there's a persistent skepticism in the general public towards the intellectual view of the current which stems from a widely accepted sentiment, that there's a inherent disconnect from reality in intellcetual debates, that they represent the observation down from the ivory tower.  On the right side of the political spectrum this contesdeness manifests itself in accusations against intellecutals of  being responsible for "fake news" or maintaing an elitist view on socienty and currant affairs. This kind of populist anti-Intellecutalism  is not only a phenomenon of recent political developments: Theodor W. Adorno noted already in his 1967 lecture "Aspekte des neuen Rechtsradikalismus" (Aspects of Contemporary Right-Wing Radicalism) what central role Anti-Intellectualism plays in right wing ideology. Adorno explains this distrust and hostility in terms of an ideology, which views the intellectual 

> " as a kind of vagrant in life, an ‘air person’ [...]. According to this ideology, whoever does not participate in the division of labour, whoever is not bound by their profession to a particular position and thus also to quite particular ideas, but has instead preserved their freedom of spirit, this person is a kind of rascal who needs to be brought into line."

The loud and undifferentiated attacks on intellectual thinking from the right and populist fringes, which until today feed into attacks on academia, science and the press,  at times obscure the fact, that selfcritical reflection is an integral part of intellectualism itself. With this in mind we turn to a strain of critique of the intellecutal and his or her position in society, which doesn't stem from authotorianism and ressentiment, but from the retrospective view of the rise of national socialism, antisemitism and the passivity of some of the times most influental intellectuals.  

# *A similar critique? Hannah Arendt on Stefan Zweig and Jean Améry on Romain Rolland*

The biographies of Hannah Arendt and Jean Améry show parallels in important points: Both were born before the end of the First World War, both fled from National Socialism, both attempted political resistance in some form, both were interned in the camp Gurs for a while, both dealt intellectually with their experiences after the war. When shifting the view away from their biographies and towards their actual body of work, the similarties fade in the background and sharp contrasts appear: Améry was very critical of Arendt's concept of a "banality of evil", which she famously developed in [her book about the Eichmann-trial in Jerusalem](https://books.google.de/books/about/Eichmann_in_Jerusalem.html?id=jsDtAAAAMAAJ&redir_esc=y). Nonetheless there's a distinct parallel and similartiy in argumentation between two essays of both thinkers which were published about 30 years apart:

 In ["Portrait of a Period"](https://hannah-arendt-edition.net/vol_text.html?id=/3p_III-009-PortraitPeriodMenorah.xml&lang=de),  published first in the Menorah Journal in 1943, Arendt lays out a critical review of Stefan Zweig's ["The World of Yesterday"](https://books.google.de/books?id=YrJjc9KADLwC&printsec=frontcover&dq=stefan+zweig+the+world+of+yesterday&hl=en&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwjXnNWws5bvAhWODuwKHQgGBfoQ6AEwAHoECAIQAg#v=onepage&q=stefan%20zweig%20the%20world%20of%20yesterday&f=false). To Arendt, Zweig's nostalgic – and in the light of Zweig's suicidein 1942 quite tragical – autobiography is the manifest of a humanistic, but in the end apolitical thinker, who was so entrenched in his social circle of fame, culture and evenly famous friends, that he made himself comfortable in a world which provided emancipation only to the famous and thus experienced the rise of facism and national socialism in europe not as historic and societal developments, but as a "natural catastrophe". 

A relatively similar sentiment is formulated in Jean Amérys "Von der Verwundbarkeit des Humanismus" ("On the vulnerability of humanism"), first published in 1981, three years after Améry took his own life, in a collection of reviews of early 20th century literature from the post-war and post-shoa viewpoint titled ["Bücher aus der Jugend unseres Jahrhunderts"](https://books.google.de/books/about/Bücher_aus_der_Jugend_unseres_Jahrhunde.html?id=ZqM3AAAAIAAJ&redir_esc=y) ("Books from the youth of our century"). In the essay Améry, like Arendt, takes Stefan Zweigs "The World of Yesterday" as the starting point of a reflection about the humanistic intellectual in times of crises. In contrast to Arendt, Améry does not dwell on Zweig, but from a description in "The World of Yesterday" shifts his view to Romain Rolland and his magnum Opus, ["Jean-Christophe"](https://www.britannica.com/topic/Jean-Christophe). In the person of Rolland and in his thought, represented in "Jean-Christophe", Améry recognizes the titling "vulnerability of humanism": A pacifistic and culturally fixated humanism, which is obsessed with arts, aesthetics and high values, but because of its inwardness and gentleness shys away from action, loses sight of reality and "schließlich scheitert an einer Welt, in der auch Menschlichkeit sich wappnen muss" ("finally fails in a world in which even humanity must arm itself"). Amérys allegation is, similar to the one put forward by Arendt regarding Zweig, that the kind of cultural humanism represented by Rolland is apolitical – and thus ineffective. 

So did Arendt and Améry, two thinkers whose bodies of work and underlying thought normally aren't considered related, indeed formulate a similar critique of the apolitical intellectual who is disconnected from the real world? When both essays are contextualised in the respective body of work, distances are revealed in the apparent affinity, which correspond with broader strains in the distinct thinking of Arendt and Améry.

# *The Paria, the Parvenue and the "gilded trellises": The roots of Hannah Arendts critique of Zweig*

As Seyla Benhabib pointed out in her 1996 monography "[The Reluctant Modernism of Hannah Arendt](https://politicalscience.yale.edu/publications/reluctant-modernism-hannah-arendt)", Arendts biography of Rahel Varnhagen, which she completed while living in exile in Paris in 1938, contains a guiding theme for her whole thought and philosophy: Using the categorys of the *Paria* and the *Parvenue* Arendt describes Rahel Varnhagens – who was a German writer during the late 18th and early 19th centuries who hosted a very influental salon, was jewish by birth but converted to Christianity – ambivalent relationship with her jewish origin amidst the struggles of assimilation and longed emancipation in bourgious society. Not only does Arendt in Varnhagen recognize the transformation from the ideal-typical *Parvenue*, who tries with all strength to adapt to the majority society and thereby self-denyingly rejects his or her own identity, to the *Paria*, who comes to terms with the own identity and is able to turn it from a social flaw to a form of individual resistance. She also critizes a mode of reflecting and interacting with the world, which is prominent in Varnhagens life, corresponds with her cultural and intellectual engagement with her surroundings and is described by Arendt as romantic "Innerlichkeit": an introspective way of thinking and understanding, which is mostly concerned with subjective feelings and emotions. Arendt argues that this attitude leads to a confusion of what is private and what is public, in which the boundaries between both spheres are neglected and therefore a real political stance towards the world, which is based upon mutual action in a shared worl, becomes impossible. 

The echoes of those sentiments – the differentiation between the Parvenue, who in order to blend into society denies her or his own identity and the societal structures which brought her or him into the position of the outsider in the first place and the conscious Pariah, who accepts her or his experencie of diffenrence and turns it into a source of strenght together with a profound critique of a nonpolitical "Innerlichkeit" – also are the guiding themes of Arendt's critique of Zweig in her 1943 essay. From this perspective Arendts condemnation of Zweigs withdrawal into a "reservation" secluded by "very thick [...] gilded trellises" has to be aligned with her description of the typical Parvenue, who denies her or his own identiy and the identy-based rejection by the majority society in order to fit in comfortably. The backdrop of Arendts critique also becomes apparent in the way she talks about Zweig's nostalgic depiction of prewar Europe, which is focused on arts and culture, interpersed with feelings rather than with critical distance – and thus invites comparison to the "Innerlichkeit" of Varnhagen.

When putting Arendts essay about Zweig in the context of her thinking laid out in earlier works, it becomes apparent that her critique is founded upon her differentiation of the Paria and the Parvenue and thus on ways of positioning oneself – and ones particularity – in the context of ones surroundings and the whole society. The cause of Zweigs distortet view of the world, which in Arendt's telling lead him to live an apolitical live, lies in a misdirected mode of identification and social positionality in society, which disguises society and the world, as they really are. 

# *Disillusionment in the face of subjective suffering: Jean Amérys thought on the vulnerability of humanism* 

While for Jean Améry Jewish identity also is a topic of thought – he discusses the experience of being made a Jew by the Nazis without believing in God or knowing much about Jewish cutlure in his essay *On the Necessity and Impossibility of Being a Jew* ("Über Zwang und Unmöglichkeit, Jude zu sein"),  published in the collection [*At the Mind's Limits: Contemplations by a Survivor of Auschwitz and Its Realities*](https://iupress.org/9780253211736/at-the-minds-limits/) – identity and self-chosen positionalty in society aren't the underlying threads of his critique of "vulnerable humanism". It is not mainly the personal withdrawal into a secluded elitist cultural sphere or the denial of a forced upon identity led by the desire to fit in, but the model of humanism advoctaed by Romain itsself, which is the object of critique in Améry's essay. 

Jean Améry, who was born as Hanns Chaim Mayer in Austria and in his youth felt quite at home in his rural surroundings and nature, correspondingly was drawn to the philosophy of german existentialism, rooted in nature and the yearn for a supposed authenticity. In his autobiograpically inspired "[Unmeisterliche Wanderjahre](https://www.klett-cotta.de/buch/Améry/Unmeisterliche_Wanderjahre/4590)" ("Unmasterly wandering years", no english translation avaiable), Améry looks back on both his youthful affection for german existentialism and his following enthusiasm for the Logical Empiricism of the Wiener Kreis as subordinations under differently concepted, but both in their own way delusonary systems of thougt: neither of them take the reality of society or history into account when understanding the world. 

This selfcritical retrospection to a big extent is informed by Amérys experience of being persecuted, tortured and interned in different concentration camps. In his essay "At the Mind's Limits", which lends its title to the collection mentioned above, Améry reflects upon "the intellectucal in Auschwitz" (S. 01). He describes how neither analytical thinking nor an aesthetic understanding of the world were of any value in the brutal world of the camp because they lost their foundation in a social reality. Améry comes to the conclusion, that the only thing the experience in the camp did to "the intellectual" in the realm of thougt was "to bring about this philosophical disillusionment, for which other, perhabs ifinitely more gifted and penetrating minds must struggle a lifetime." (S. 20)

The perspective from his subjective experience of suffering, which is made lucid in his thoughts on the intellectual in Auschwitz, shapes a lot of Amérys essayistic writing and is fundamental for his sharp, concise and sometimes painfully honest   observations. It is this perspective and the experience of "philosophical dillusionment" – the realization, that intellectual thought has to have a correspondance with (social) reality to be meaningful – that shape not only Amérys retrospective assessment of his early philosophical leanings, but also his critique of "vulnerable humanism": humanistic Intellectualism which is constrained in its own system of thought, be it as a cultural humanism focused on aesthetic beauty or as a militant humanism which justifies any means of its own realization by a fictional end, to Améry always is a contradiction to an active and political meaningful stance towards the world. This is the basis from which Amérys critizises the dreamy and hopeful worldview of Rolland – which to Améry   amounts to a denial of reality, which in the end undermines Rollands humanistic intentions.
