### me
I'm a master's student at the [Center for Research on Antisemitism](https://www.tu-berlin.de/fakultaet_i/zentrum_fuer_antisemitismusforschung/menue/home/) with a background in history and political science. I am mainly concerned with the history of ideas of anti-Semitism, critical theory and social psychology, and the transformations of racism and anti-Semitism in the Digital Society. Besides that I love photography, literature and am a part-time record collector. At this place I plan to capture some of my finished and unfinished work.
